An Introduction to Python (with some Science)
=============================================

This is an introduction and some projects for beginners in Python,
using turtle graphics.
The projects all connect to science and mathematics
(STEM) subjects outside coding.

The first two modules are adapted for the Raspberry Pi,
but could easily be interpreted for any computer running Python 3.
The project modules
(modules 3 and up)
do not depend at all on the type of computer in use.

Polemical footnote
------------------

Many coding projects for young people focus on the creation of games,
as if this were the only use of computers likely to interest them.
The author's view is
that the real world is more interesting than any game,
and
that coding is a game addictive enough in its own right.
