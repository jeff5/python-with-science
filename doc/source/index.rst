An Introduction to Python
#########################

This is an introduction and some projects for beginners in Python.
The projects use turtle graphics so results are visually pleasing from the start.

They were written for an after-school coding club at junior level
(years 4 to 6).
The projects are challenging for this age-group,
but the club is strongly-supported by knowledgeable helpers.

The introductory two modules are adapted for the Raspberry Pi,
but could easily be interpreted for any computer running Python 3.
The project modules themselves
(modules 3 and up)
do not depend at all on the type of computer in use.

... with some science
*********************

These projects can be taken purely as exercises in coding and debugging.
However, each project connects to science and mathematics
(STEM) topics outside the coding:
shapes in nature, colour perception and mathematical curves.

Many coding projects for young people focus on the creation of a game,
as if this were the only use of a computer likely to interest them.
The author has never grown out of play,
but his view is
that the real world is more interesting than any game.
